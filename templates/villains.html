              The Kobold Mother is a fierce creature that fiercely guards her
              young. She is a formidable opponent in combat, wielding a crude
              but deadly weapon, and using her ferocity to her advantage. She is
              much larger and stronger than the Lost Kobold and is able to take
              more damage. Her fighting style is more aggressive, she will
              relentlessly pursue the player and will not hesitate to attack
              them if they are seen as a threat to her offspring. The Kobold
              Mother is a formidable enemy for the player to face early on, and
              serves as a reminder that the player's actions have consequences.

              The Kobold Queen is the leader of the kobold tribe and commands
              great respect from her subjects. She is a formidable opponent in
              combat, wielding a powerful weapon and using her mastery of dark
              magic to curse her foes. Her attacks are swift and savage, and her
              strikes are capable of dealing massive damage to the player. She
              is also able to apply a curse to the player, which will deal
              damage over time and can only be cured before time runs out. The
              Kobold Queen is a formidable enemy that will test the player's
              combat skills and strategic thinking, as they must find a way to
              cure the curse and defeat her in battle. The player must be
              careful, for the Queen is more powerful than the previous kobolds,
              and will not hesitate to kill them with her curse if they are not
              well prepared.

              formidable weapon and uses dark magic to curse her foes, similar
              to the kobold queen, but with even more devastating effects. Her
              attacks are swift and savage, capable of dealing massive damage to
              the player. She also has the ability to devour the player's soul,
              which will instantly kill them if they don't move out of the way.
              The player must be extremely careful when facing the Kobold
              Goddess, as her abilities are far more powerful than any they have
              faced before and they will need to use all their skills and
              knowledge to defeat her.

            </h1>
            <p class="lead">
              The Savage Mountain Troll is a massive and fearsome creature that
              dominates the forest. Standing at an imposing height, the troll is
              a formidable opponent for the players. It has the ability of
              self-regeneration, which makes it hard to defeat, and is able to
              deal massive damage with its single-target attack. The Savage
              Mountain Troll also has a powerful ability called "Colossal Smash"
              where it jumps into the air and smashes the ground, causing
              widespread damage to the surrounding area. Additionally, it can
              throw boulders at a target position, which can be a deadly
              surprise for the players. To make things worse, if there is no
              enemy in melee range, the Savage Mountain Troll can charge towards
              the nearest target with its death charge. The Savage Mountain
              Troll is a formidable enemy that requires careful planning and
              execution to defeat. The players must use all the skills and
              resources at their disposal to defeat the creature and emerge
              victorious.
